README for the flash particle sorter:

Provides a consistient ordering for particles in a set of flash output files
based upon the pattern in the template file given.  This will usually be the
first file in a simulation.

USAGE:

<mpi running information> partSort <filename w/o number> <template file number> <first file to sort> <last file to sort>

an example would be:

    mpirun -np 4 partSort driventurb_hdf5_part_ 0 1 4

This will sort files 1-4 using file 0 as the template.
