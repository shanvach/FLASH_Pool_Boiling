40 40 40        ; global size of the problem along each dimension
8               ; The size of the datatype, usually the data are real*8
1               ; The number of records in each file
3               ; The number of files to compare


The first two lines are the pathnames to the files being compared.
In this instance, if the utility is running from $FLASHHOME, then the 
files are in $FLASHHOME/object and $FLASHHOME/cube. The files are
always named FL3xxxx, where xxxx in the file number. 
Griddump's interface is Grid_dump(vars,numvars,blockId,gcell), where
For this utility to be usable, the call should always be made with 
gcell = .false., the utility only compares the interior domain
correctly. The variable numvars determines the number on line 6 of the
input. Each variable dumped in a single call to Grid_dump represents a
record. The last line is determined by the number of times Grid_dump
is called in the run, since each time it is called it generates a new file.
