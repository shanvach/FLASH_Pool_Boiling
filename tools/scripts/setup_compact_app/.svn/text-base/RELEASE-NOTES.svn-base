The Flash Center for Computational Science is pleased to announce the
availability of a repository of compact/mini applicatons. The
repository is available for download from the flash web pages.  The
applications are already configured and contain all required source
files. The only customization is needed in the Makefile.h file for
specific target machines. Documentation for the use of compact/mini
applications in the repository is also included.

Users desirous of downloading the repository should sign a licensing
agreement available from http://flash.uchicago.edu/Code-request. The
same licensing agreement also holds for the download of the FLASH
code. Users can opt for code alone, compact/mini apps alone, or both. 

The compact/mini applications included in the current release are :
  GuardCell - unit test
  I/O - unit test
  Eos - unit test
  Hydrodynamics - Sedov blast wave
  Gravity - Poisson solve using multipole and multigrid methods
  PFFT - Parallel multi-dimension FFT 
  Diffusion - ConductionDelta (heat conduction)
            - MGDStep (multigroup diffusion)

Development of the FLASH Code was funded by the DOE-supported
ASC/Alliance Center for Astrophysical Thermonuclear Flashes,
and continues to be funded by DOE NNSA and OASCR.  We
acknowledge support received from Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory and the University of Chicago.

All publications resulting from the use of the FLASH Code must
acknowledge the Flash Center for Computational Science.
  Addition of the following text to the paper acknowledgments
will be sufficient. 

         "The software used in this work was in part developed by the
         DOE-supported Flash Center for Computational Science
         at the University of Chicago."
