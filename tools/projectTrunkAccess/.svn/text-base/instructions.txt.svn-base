Instructions for creating a pruned FLASH trunk tarball ready to be
distributed.


1). Check out a clean copy of trunk and the last FLASH release (this
is FLASH3.3_release at the time of writing the instructions).

2). Edit trunk_additions.sh so that the variables flash_trunk and
flash_release point to the code checked out in step 1.

3). Run trunk_additions.sh.  This will create a file named
trunk_additions.txt which tells you all source directories that are in
trunk but are not in release.

4). Copy trunk_additions.txt into a new text file named,
e.g. trunk_releasable.txt.  Edit this new file so that it contains the
complete list of new directories from trunk which we want included in
the tarball.  For example, if we want to include all directories from
FLASH3.3_release plus a new directory named
Particles/ParticlesMain/active/charged in our tarball then all
directories should be removed from trunk_releasable.txt except:

source/Particles/ParticlesMain/active/charged
source/Particles/ParticlesMain/active/charged/HybridPIC

Notice that all sub-directories of an included directory must be
listed.

Be aware that new stub directories in trunk must also be listed.  This
is because FLASH subroutines like Driver_initSourceTerms depend on the
new stub subroutines.

5). Edit the variables in create_project_tar.sh.  The variable
trunk_additions should be set to trunk_additions.txt and the variable
trunk_access in our case should be set to trunk_releasable.txt.

6). Run create_project_tar.sh to create the new tarball.
