Flash File Stitcher readme 

Usage:
flashStitcher <flags> baseName splitNumber fileNumber

the -n,-s, and -i flags are presently required

Arguments:
-s : how many split files are there for the target.  
i.e. if the file is split into four separate files, use -s 4.
this must be specified.

-z : padding for the split number.
Flash, when it outputs a split file, denotes the split number with a _sX, 
where x will have a constant length, using zero padding.  presently the default
is 4 (so it would look like s0001, for example).

-t : the file type.  This can be used to differentiate between different
        file types.  Valid values are:
        chk
        plt_cnt
        part (coming soon!)

-n : the basename for the file to stitch together

-f : the file format.  HDF5 is presently the only file format supported.

-i : the output file number.


For reference the flash naming convention for output files is:

basename_(splitnumber)_format_type_filenumber

The splitnumber is omitted in unsplit files.





The filename passed in should be the filename with the split number remvoed.

The target_filename will be overwritten with this utility, so be careful.
