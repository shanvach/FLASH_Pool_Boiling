This version of fidlr uses the native HDF5 support built into IDL 5.6.
Earlier versions of IDL will not work.  

Only HDF5 is supported by these routines -- HDF v. 4.x support has been
dropped.

There is preliminary support for spherical geometries in 2-d only.
Performance is not great, but it is tough to make it better without
sacrificing quality/ accuracy, or resorting to coding it as a DLM
(which I don't want to do -- that is a pain to support).

Particles are partially supported, and in 2-d Cartesian only.  The
tagging does not work at the moment.

Added netcdf support, any Flash netcdf data should work the same way as
HDF5 data, minus particle data. This will be coming soon.

Added netcdf particle support.
