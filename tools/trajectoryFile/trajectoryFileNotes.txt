Notes on the particle trajectory file format.

v0.1

Goal:  Aggregate particle data from a single run so that it can be used
       in post-processing efficiently (i.e. reduced disk-access)


Fields:

Simulation info -- As in FLASH output
lists (runtime parameters/scalars) as in Flash output

Simulation time: length: number of datapoionts (num particle files)
	   Extract the times from the files as we go through them.  Each
	   entry here should correspond to the simulation time.

particle names: As in FLASH output

partcles: NPROPS x nTimeSteps x numParticles

below was orignal consideration, now using the modified particles dataset.
Particle_nnnn:  length: num timesteps s x num Particle Properties
	       Copy over the particle data (the numPartProps) from each file
	       encoutnered.  nnnn corresponds to the tag number for that 
	       particle.  There should be a number of these fields equal to
	       the global number of particles in a run.

	       Need to make sure that particles that have left the domain
	       are properly handled.  Check the block number?
               Sorter does nothing to particle data.  If number disappears, 
	       write straight -1.'s to particle data.  May have to reconstruct
	       last known position later.  I could only see this happening on
	       a restart. 

Notes on size:

Initial runs:
10K particles/run
20 properties
10K particleFiles/run

~16GB particle data/run

Full-scale: as initial runs except:
1M particles/run
This will most liley require revisions and extensions to the format due to 
estimated file size.
