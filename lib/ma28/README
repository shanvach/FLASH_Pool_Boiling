The file build.csh has been removed.  This is because I now
automatically generate build.csh when libinfo.py is called.  I add
this level of indirection because I need to pass the FFLAGS [DEBUG |
OPT | TEST] compilation options to the Makefile when we create the
library.

This is done because the FFLAGS [DEBUG | OPT | TEST] variable contains
the crucial promote reals to 8 bytes flag.  It also ensures that
consistent compilation flags are used for this library and all of the
source files in the FLASH object directory.  Primarily though, this
will prevent errors where an 8 byte real in FLASH is passed to the
ma28 library.
