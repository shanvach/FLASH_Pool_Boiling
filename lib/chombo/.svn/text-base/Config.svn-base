# Library configuration file
#
# I expect the chombo library to be built for all required dimensionalities
# before even invoking the FLASH setup script.  I do no automated build
# from the setup script.
#
# I label chombo as EXTERNAL (even though the source is available) to avoid 
# the setup script making assumptions about the library name.  Chombo 
# uses a combination of system, precision, compiler name and 
# dimensionality to construct library names.  These are constructed in several 
# chombo Makefiles and I can't see an easy way to get at these strings.
# With EXTERNAL I can just rely on the user specifying CFLAGS_CHOMBO 
# and LIB_CHOMBO to pass required pre-processor definitions and library names.
#
# The chombo library (as built for FLASH) depends on mpi.  It can also 
# depend on hdf5.
