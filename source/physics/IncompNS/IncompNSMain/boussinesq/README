Please observe at least the following cautions when using the under-development 
Rayleigh_Benard and Rayleigh_Benard_Stretch Subpackages


UG or AMR Grid:
  1) constmass option not tested but supported
  2) turbulant viscosity modeling not tested but should be supported
  3) inflow / outflow boundary conditions not tested but should be supported

Regular Grid:
  1) NONFIXED BLOCK SIZE mode not tested but supported
  2) constmass option not supported
    a) ins_getBulkVelocity needs modification
    b) ins_pressgradients needs modification
  3) turbulant viscosity model not currently supported
    a) ins_vt needs modification
    b) ins_velgradtensor needs modification
  4) inflow / outflow / neumann boundary conditions not currently supported
    a) ins_computeQinout needs modification
    b) ins_convectVelout needs modification
    c) ins_rescaleVelout needs modification
  5) Some Grid Package support functions are not currently supported 
    a) Grid_getSingleCellVol needs modifications
    b) ??
