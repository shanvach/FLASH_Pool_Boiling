  build process for integrating the two libraries
  the list of steps for getting Grid_chombo going

Changes needed for building process.
     Chombo -- Makefile
            -- source
     FLASH  -- Makefiles
            -- source
            -- 
        link problems likely to occur (interoperability of languages)

    FLASH API changes --- pointer problems
                      --- chombo PPM

Prioritization of 4 things on the board
   1.  ANAG unsplit PPM
   2.  AMR Poisson
   3.  CT MHD Solver
   4.  Particles (design document for what is going to go into Chombo for 
                  the particles framework)

Design document for Grid_chombo, Hydro_chombo.
