\f0\fs24 \cf0 Mini Meeting 2.9.2005 -- Katie, Dan, Anshu\
\
How can we come up with a way to standardize IO for various mesh packages?\
\
What do we really need to visualize the simulation?\
\
	* We need parent, child and bound box to identify each.\
	* This can be a data structure that is stored in Grid_IO_data\
\
So there will be 3 types of Grid_data\
	* Grid_data -- the regular data for Grid\
	* Grid_IO_data -- our new data that holds the parent, child, bound_box\
	* Grid_physical_data -- which holds unk	\
