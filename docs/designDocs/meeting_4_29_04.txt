NOTES

* boundary conditions approved.

* Unit testing
  what to do with EOS -- we still don't know
  Andrew will do unit testing for hydro, grid


  Andrew - mpi should just be treated as another library in Makefile.h
  need to clean up Makefiles -- assigned to Dan
  
  to do -- bring in the sites info


* Where to put user defined functions in PM?


* Should we change the way over riding is done?  right now capablilites is in 
setups direcotry.  should we make each flash unit have its own direcotry 
for user defined functions.


* something about keeping a default setup 

pm3 
    user_defined
	amr_1blk_bcset
		manipulate your args
	Call Gridbcset()





Andrew Problem in Flash2, if a user wants to change something in hydro1d
then have to go through 15 setups to change

need a well defined/designed user_defined directory


EOS
 * Katherine - EOS, where to put it.
	     it is a utility

 * Andrew - What is EOS? does it solve?  a set of equations? or does it
            help solve specific problems?

	    There is a place here for long names EOS_do_this_block
	    Anshu will give this a try because similar to Grid interface

Conclusion: Everyone agrees, not a mapper

Andrew - Is it a top level module?
Katherine - No




nxb, nyb, nzb belong in Grid.h

flasb.h our global defines

wrap mpi
change MPI_COMM_WORLD


Jignesh - do MPI calls

Dan - makefile.h,  grid interface, setup interface


Katherine/Katie After Discussion:

Each high level unit will have a user_defined directory which can have
subdirectories test1, test2, test3,

so if you want to customize you will add the file change to the user_defined
directory NOT setup.  There will be a generic provided for you in setup.
