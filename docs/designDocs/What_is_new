New units 

MHD -- two implementations:
       1. imported from FLASH2 (8wave directionally split)
       2. 2D unsplit staggered mesh

Sourceterms 
   Burn -- Aprox13 network

   Stir
 
Gravity -- four implementations
         1. Constant
         2. PlanePar
	 3. PointMass
         4. Poisson -- with multipole solver
 

Particles -- Lagrangian tracers, for Uniform grid only


New implementations of Units

EOS : Fully ionized plasma eos of arbitrary degeneracy (helmholtz)

Driver  :  New timestepping method for staggered mesh

IO :  - pnetcdf implementations for all meshes
      - direct IO (every processor writes its own) for UG
      - Particles IO for UG

New Test Problems
 
     1. Several new unit tests
        -- Gravity/Poisson
        -- Particles
        -- Burn
        -- IO
     2. Isentropic vortex
     3. Cellular detonation
     4. dust collapse   

Enhancements to existing code

General : All API's have defined F90 interfaces

Grid : - Full support for face variables
       - more robust boundary handling 
       - enhanced data get/put interfaces
       - support for some curvilinear coordinates 

IO : Full support for non-fixed blocksizes

Setup script : 



Enhancements that are available, but not guaranteed to be correct :

  - transparent handing of non-conservation variables from 
    its attribute in the definition
  - More generalized handling of non-cartesian coordinate systems
  - masked guardcell fill in Paramesh3
  - ability to handle internal boundaries and obstacles in PM3
  - non-default interpolation methods in AMR
