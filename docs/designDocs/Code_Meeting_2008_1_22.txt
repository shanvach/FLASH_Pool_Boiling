Continued Code responsibilities

Klaus - More testing of the multigrid, Particles time integration
Paul  - Continue with dimensioning checkpoints with MDIM for all tree 
        data strcutures, separate plot from checkpoints so plotfiles
        have the grid used for the calculation and not the newly refined
        grid.
Peter - Modification to the setup script to map particle properties to
        grid data structures
Chris - Get the poistest with 13 peaks translated to particles based 
        problem and use particles based refinement.
Lynn  - General supervision of the problems failing in test suite,
        testing stuff in debug mode etc
Anshu - Testing particles based refinement, checking out the restrict 
        on all levels in PM2, testing 2d spherical multipole, implementation
        of general Particles_updateAttributes when Peter had finished the
        mapping. More testing of PFFT for use with UG only. 
Dongwook - RHD test problem


User's guide responsibilites
Klaus - GridBoundaryConditions, update on use of curvilinear coordinates
        and interpolation related issues. 
Paul -  Update the IO chapter.
Peter - The setup script changes and the sections on the use of multigrid
        solver
Chris - Active particles mapping algorithm and updating description of the
        pancake problem
Lynn  - The GridSolver chapter with description of the multigrid algorithm.
Anshu - Update the Grid chapter, writeup on Pfft.
John Zuhone - Active particles time integration
Dongwook - Problem setups for RHD  

Responsibilities for Coding Violations
Klaus - Monitors, interpolation and boundary related Grid, Particles time
        integration
Paul  - IO
Peter - multigrid robodocs
Chris -
Lynn - Eos, Burn, general keep an eye
Anshu - Grid, Particles, Pfft
Dongwook - RHD/MHD
