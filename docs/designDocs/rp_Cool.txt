        name of a FLASH SPECIES (mass fraction variable) that tracks the mass
        fraction of electrons, for purposes of the Radloss implementation of the
        Cool source term unit. Note that Cool/Radloss may expect that only two
        mass fraction variables are declared, one for protons and one for
        electrons. A species of this name should be declared either in the
        simulation's Config file or by including a code unit that declares it.
