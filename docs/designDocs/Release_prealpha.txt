Now I am using this file to compile issues that still remain
unresolved in various chapters of the user's guide. (The original file
is still intact at the bottom) I also want people
to start marking chapters they have read.


UsersGuide Sections  [%%DEFER]
---------------------------------------------------------
Getting Started
   Intro : Anshu -- There is still reference to going further with
                     FLASH, and a chapter. I think they should be removed.
   Quickstart : Anshu -- read, the picture of xflash needs updating. 
   Setup [Murali]
     -- Finished except for explanations for the following.
        + nonpermanentguardcells
        + tau 
        + Particles_mapPropToStr.F90 
        + Simulation_mapVarToStr.F90
        + Simulation_mapStrToVar.F90
        These one line explanations are better given by somebody 
        who uses these features.

      sendOutput (ask Katie), and single cell volume function.

Here is a list of the units that will be released for the PREALPHA version of 
FLASH3 in April.  Following is a list of the Users Guide chapters and the people 
responsible for the text.  If you are responsible for a portion of the Users'
Guide, then you are ALSO responsible for ensuring the code Robodocs are up to 
date for that section.  You can, of course, delegate responsibility as long as
you make sure the job is done.  NOTE CHANGED RESPONSIBILITIES below.

Units to be released
--------------------------
Driver     --- Robodoc documentation upto date
RuntimeParameters -- Robodoc and initial latex up to date RP_stampIgnored
MultiSpecies      -- Robodoc and initial latex up to date
PhysicalConstants -- Robodoc and initial latex up to date
Logfile
Profiler
TestSuite
Fidlr (to be renamed) -- has been renamed
Grid:  Paramesh{2,3} and UG --API Robodoc upto date except for saved data bits
Hydro
Eos:  Gamma and MultiGamma  --- Robodoc and initial latex up to date
                                Multigamma needs testing
IO:  HDF5 for parallel and serial, for UG and Paramesh
Simulations:  Sod, Sedov, 2Blast, Advect, unitTests:Grid/Eos -- Robodoc uptodate
    For Sod, Sedov, Advect: latex and Robodocs are up to date
 
Significant items that will NOT be released contrary to previous beliefs

To Do list for release

  -- Restart --- UG/PAramesh Serial/Parallel include in the test suite


  -- Fidlr   --- chk on more than 1 procs 
             --- Definitely test in last week before release
             --- make is self consistent, the buttons should
                 have sensible behavior

  -- Some testing with debug flag
     specify in the documentation that -test option is for user's to
     try their own combinations.
     Add a test to verify the "valid parameter range feature"

  -- Somebody needs to document what the fluxes are in hydro in the Config file
     Some of these are obvious, but others are definitely not, rho, u, p, ut, utt, e, eint
