Noel was reminded to get a test into the test suite that does restart.

Fidlr needs to be tested with
a) checkpoint and plot files need to be tested on more than one proc.
b) test buttons or disable
Noel and Lynn will handle it.

Anshu is having trouble setting up unitTest/Grid with alternate grids.  Murali will take a look offline.


unitTest/EOS is failing when using Multigamma.  Problem is either in Multigamma or Multispecies.
Lynn will test Multispecies unit test, then look at Multigamma.

Changing names of Grid_saved..... to Grid_scratch....  Saved variables will be named "SCRATCH"


We do not support Face Variables completely in Grid.  We need to change the documentation to indicate 
that we don't really support it, despite what some robodocs say.  "For Future use"  Or Anshu will just 
implement it!

Anshu is planning on implementing boundary conditions before the release.
Isn't she brave?!

Documentation
-http://flash.uchicago.edu/website/codesupport/home.py?submit=violations
-------------
CreatingProblems.tex -- change to Sod so that we can include Simulation_* information
Change main .tex file and release documents to include.

Change DEV comments to "DEV FUTURE" so that Coding Violations page is less confusing.

Lynn/Noel will take over fidlr documentation and cleanup.

Gone through Release_prealpha.txt
   Stubs for Simulation/Particles_mapPropToStr/VarToStr
   xflash QuickStart needs to be attended.


Klaus is pointing out things we should be aware of while writing
a) No longer need to escape \_ in routine names
b) use \code{} whenever possible 
c) use \codeseg{} rather than \verbatim{} if possible
d) No need to have empty parentheses after the name of a function.  E.g. write
    \code{Simulation_init} rather than \code{Simulation_init()}
e) What about <> rather than parentheses?  Use <this might change> as a convention.
f) List of variable/parameters (especially in Grid).  A new Quick Reference section in grid that
has the entire \api and \rpi links.  Useful for bringing all the information into one place.  
So everybody make this section and put in links to the robodoc documentation.  Or at the very least make
a section that has Runtime Parameters and the API listing.

Need a table of contents at the front of these Chapters:
a) Simulation problems
b) Grid?


Lynn will comment out sections of simulation problems that are not being released.


=============================================================
Supercomputing paper -- taking a look 
	       concentrate on post-processing and visualization.  Writing in separate document
	       SCPaper.rtf

Tutorial submission -- Katie thinks this will only take an hour.

WorldComp paper -- anybody who wants to go needs to tell Carrie so she can get
approval.  Lynn will make the paper camera-ready.
