\
How to handle the networks that are provided in the code, aprox13.\
\
Issue is that each network needs to initialize the multifluid database with the correct species properties (like atomic weight, electron charge etc.)\
\
The species also need to be initialized on each cell in the grid.\
\
\
Questions:  Should we hide this initialization from the user in an example network?  Or should the initialization be in the API.  For example, should there be a Composition_init?  or should this be implemented under the hood?  How can we make it so there is a common interface?  A user can add in their own implementation or use one that was out of the box.}
