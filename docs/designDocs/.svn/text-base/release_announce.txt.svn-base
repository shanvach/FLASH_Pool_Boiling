The Flash Center is pleased to announce the release of the
next major version of the FLASH code, version 3.0. FLASH 3.0 offers
many advantages over the FLASH 2.5 release. The more significant
advantages of FLASH 3.0 are :

* Clean public interfaces for each code unit.

* Ability to switch between uniform and adaptive Grid for same
application. 

* Ability to use directionally unsplit time integration.

* Support for blocksizes not defined at compile time. This feature can
enable FLASH to use meshes that do not require that all blocks be
equal in size. 

* Increased modularity through better encapsulation of code
units, making it considerably easier to incorporate third party software
into FLASH.

* New, more scalable algorithms for Particles management.

* Support for a uniform grid.

* Support for face variables.

* Unit test framework and many unit tests.

* Enhanced setup script with seamless library management and the
ability to suggest units a user might have neglected. The setup script
also allows uses to create shortcuts to reduce typing.

* Extensive web published API documentation for all units in the code.

* More robust and efficient IO implementation.



Capablities added since the beta release include:

* Full support for active particles, including new, more scalable
algorithms for mapping the particles to the mesh.

* A new multigrid solver for self gravity (courtsey Paul Ricker). 

* Cosmology unit

* A parallel FFT solver that can be used with Uniform grid

* Many simulation setups and unit tests.

The FLASH3.0 release is available for download with a license agreement
at:

http://flash.uchicago.edu/website/download/home.html/

A stripped down version of FLASH3 that may be downloaded without a
license is also available at the same location. This version is
essentially the FLASH framework without any implementations.
Flash Center is also providing support for "add-ons" to the
code. Please see the secion on "What's new in this release" in the
first chapter of the user's guide for details.


Additionally, the FLASH testing software FlashTest, which became
available with the alpha release, continues to be available for
download at:

http://flash.uchicago.edu/website/codesupport/

Many, but not all parts of FLASH3 are backwards-compatible with
FLASH2.  The Flash code group has written extensive documentation
detailing how to make the transition from FLASH2 to FLASH3 as smooth
as possible.  The user should look to:

http://flash.uchicago.edu/website/codesupport/

The website also contains other documentation including
a user's guide and a developer's section.  A new feature in FLASH3
documentation is the online description of the public interface
routines to various code units.

Development of the FLASH Code was funded by the DOE-supported
ASC/Alliance Center for Astrophysical Thermonuclear Flashes.  We
acknowledge support received from Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory and the University of Chicago.

All publications resulting from the use of the FLASH Code must
acknowledge the ASC/Alliance Center for Astrophysical Thermonuclear
Flashes.  Addition of the following text to the paper acknowledgments
will be sufficient.Gravity_potentialListOfBlocks

         Flashes at the University of Chicago."
