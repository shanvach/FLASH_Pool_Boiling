\
Interpolation:\
	Relativistic vs Non-Relativistic\
	Compile time?  Runtime?\
	who owns it?\
	leaning towards library\
	dan points out interpolation shouldn't be a user option at all - setup is the 			high level interface of the problem\
\
Tree:\
	where to place the interpolation utilities or grid utilities\
	We want routines that aren't explicitly units to be able to be libraries, ie PM2\
		PM3, runtimeViz, interpolation\
\
\
Geometry, it should be able to be set at runtime, and get the correct interpolation...\
	but the trade off is a larger executable\
	variations:\
		type of grid -- must be known at setup\
		order of interpolance\
		geometry\
		accuracy\
		physics -- must be known at setup\
\
\
\
IO\
	scratch space, who owns it.\
	checkpoint number\
	who stores global variables like checkpoint number that get incremented -- well only one 		proc writes out checkpoint number\
	a while back we talked about having an initial state and a changed state.\
	global scalars\
		dynamic ones -\
			time, nstep, checkpoint_num, dt, redshift\
\
	IO_writeScalar, IO_readScalar\
	keyword scalar\

\
\
Particle Idea\
	Interfacing Fly code with Flash\
	these are particles with finite mass\
	split particles and flash with 2 communicators\
