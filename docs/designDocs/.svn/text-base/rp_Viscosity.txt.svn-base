    useViscosity [BOOLEAN] CONSTANT [FALSE]
        flags whether the viscosity material property is being used

    useViscosity [BOOLEAN] [TRUE]
        flags whether the viscosity material property is being used
    viscSuppressFactor [REAL] [1.0]
        Valid Values: Unconstrained
        -- allows the viscosity to be suppressed
    viscTempHigh [REAL] [1.5e8]
        Valid Values: Unconstrained
        -- turn off viscosity for temps higher than this
    viscTempLow [REAL] [3.0e5]
        Valid Values: Unconstrained
        -- turn off viscosity for temps lower than this

    diff_visc_mu [REAL] [.1]
        Valid Values: Unconstrained
        constant dynamic viscosity (used in Constant Viscosity if
        visc_whichCoefficientIsConst is 1)
    diff_visc_nu [REAL] [.1]
        Valid Values: Unconstrained
        constant kinematic viscosity (used in Constant Viscosity if
        visc_whichCoefficientIsConst is 2)
    visc_whichCoefficientIsConst [INTEGER] [2]
        Valid Values: 1, 2
        which kind of coefficient to keep constant in Constant Viscosity
        implementation; set to 1 for constant dynamic viscosity (the value of
        diff_visc_mu is used); set to 2 for constant kinematic viscosity (the
        value of diff_visc_nu is used).
