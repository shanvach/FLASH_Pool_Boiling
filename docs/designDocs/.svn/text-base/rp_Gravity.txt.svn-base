    grav_boundary_type [STRING] ["isolated"]
        Valid Values: Unconstrained
        Type of gravitational boundary condition if a Poisson solve is used for
        Gravity; string-valued version of grav_boundary. Accepts: "isolated",
        "periodic", "dirichlet", and maybe others, depending on the Poisson
        solver used. This is declared in the stub level of the Gravity unit to
        allow the Grid unit to refer to this runtime parameter even when no
        Gravity implementation is included.
    useGravity [BOOLEAN] [FALSE]
        Whether gravity calculations should be performed.

physics/Gravity/GravityMain/Poisson
    grav_temporal_extrp [BOOLEAN] [FALSE]
        extrapolate or otherwise rescale
    grav_unjunkPden [BOOLEAN] [TRUE]
        controls whether Gravity_potentialListOfBlocks attempts to restore the
        part of the "pden" ("particle density") UNK variable that is due to
        particles, or leaves "pden" as it is, after a Poisson equation solve.
        This only applies meaningfully when a "pden" variable is declared and
        the gravitational potential is calculated by solving a Poisson equation
        whose right-hand side includes a mass distribution to which both
        hydrodynamic fluid density and massive particles contribute. The "pden"
        variable will have been set to the sum of the fluid density ("dens"
        variable) and the density resulting from mapping massive particles to
        the mesh, so that is what remains in "pden" when grav_unjunkPden is set
        to FALSE. Otherwise, "dens" will be subtraced from "pden" before
        Gravity_potentialListOfBlocks returns, and "pden" will be left
        containing only the mass density that is due to particles.
    point_mass [REAL] [0.e0]
