XFLASH

1) error recovery -- it would be nice if there was some method of resetting xflash within the GUI rather than having to click the x boxes and then issue IDL>.reset all, then restart xflash.  Clearly, I've had to do this reset method a lot....

LBR 2006/04/05  -- Added DEBUG flag to xflash30 and xplot*_amr_new routines.
Slowly working on encasing extraneous print statements within 
IF (Keyword_Set(DEBUG)) then print '...blah blah'
2) Ridiculous amounts of crap written to the IDL command line as diagnostics.  It's very difficult to tell if these are important or not (e.g. in cases like log button below).  These should only display when some -debug flash is set, maybe via IDL>xflash30 -debug or when they indicate a problem!

3) Postscript output does not work correctly.  It produces a file  (upside down) but it sure misses the detail of the onscreen plot.

4) Using a mesh variable with negative numbers (e.g. vely), choosing Options: log produces no sensible error message.  It would be good if it said something like "Sorry, cannot take the log of a negative number.  Uncheck the "log" button".

DONE LBR, 2006/04/05
5) In Options: checking abs. value  Does not change the title of the plot -- there is no indication you're taking ABS

6) Unchecking "auto" on Data Range causes crashes (non-fatal).  Error in Contour about "Infinite Plot Range."  Wrong plot, no annotation on color bar.

7) Zoom box -- it zooms, but not to where you've set the box!

8) Contour Options.  Does not work.  Crashes somewhere in merge_amr.pro, line 575

9)  Vector Options.  Does not work.  Again crashes in merge_amr.

10) Particle Options.  Does not work.  Crashes in Xplot_amr_new line 1104.

DONE LBR, 2006/04/05
11) Histogram Options.  Don't know what it does.  Documentation is incomplete, and nothing seems to happen on a 2d plot.  Aah, never mind, you
need to push the bottom row "Histogram button".  See 13.

DONE
12) Floating Options.  HOOORAY! It does work.  I just thought I'd report something good.  Also, the Query button works.  Also, the 1-d slice works.

LBR 2006/04/12 Disabled histogram buttons since they don't work
13) Histogram button (down at the bottom next to Plot button).  Causes a fatal crash
