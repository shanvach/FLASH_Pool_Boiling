We will do the release incrementally every ones every 3-4 months.

Our current biggest challenge is self gravity. Likely to be needed for
the hero calculation. It is likely that work will start on it soon,
but that it might be released closer to the final release.

The other big ones still remaining :
1. MHD   ------ Dongwook is prepared to have 2D released. He will
                work on 3d once he comes to Chicago.
2. Immersed interface                  ----
3. variabl_coefficient_helmholtz    ---- We don't yet know what is it
                                         for.
4. helmholtz
5. level_set
6. Cal's networks.
7. Cosmology ? --- Maybe talk to Paul about it.

                         Timur's mhd, maybe self gravity.
                    April 07 full function release. 3d mhd full release

tutorial -- definitely in june soon after the releasee
            possibility of running tutorial at AAS, supercomputing.

Benchmark --- should be an ongoing activity
