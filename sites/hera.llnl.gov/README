Running in interactive mode:
srun -N4 -n8 -p pdebug ./flash2

Note: In order to produce large files, one must link to a special
version of MPI that has the 64 bit file system offset. This is
the library

/usr/local/tools/MPI-gnat-4938/Linux_i686/mpi/lib

In order to get this link in to the Makefile.h file, we 
added a new path:

MPIpath = /usr/local/tools/MPI-gnat-4938/Linux_i686/mpi/lib

****Update****: The stuff below is no longer necessary. The mpi compile
script, in this case mpiifort includes the path to a precompiled
farg.c. So the LIB_MPI stuff has been taken out of the Makefile.h
