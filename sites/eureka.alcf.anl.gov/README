Copy the softenvrc to ~/.softenvrc.
By default it will setup your environment for visit and serial HDF5.

For your environment to be consistent with a FLASH binary produced
with the default Makefile.h you should run
> MY_ENV=mx resoft

Note that this can be done on the login nodes and compute nodes.  The
script run_script.sh gives an example of how we do this for the
compute nodes.

To use a non-mx version of MPI run
> MY_ENV=nomx resoft
