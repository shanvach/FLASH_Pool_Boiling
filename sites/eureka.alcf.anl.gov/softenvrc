# This is your SoftEnv configuration run control file.
#
#   It is used to tell SoftEnv how to customize your environment by
#   setting up variables such as PATH and MANPATH.  To learn more
#   about this file, do a "man softenv".
#
#
# This softenvrc file will help Min Long to match compile and runtime
# stacks.  By default he wants his environment setup for visit.
# 
# The logic depends on a variable named MY_ENV ["", mx, nomx]
# which can be set on the login nodes, e.g.
#
#   MY_ENV=nomx resoft
#
# and also on the compute nodes in a job submission script, e.g.
#
#   source /etc/profile.d/00softenv.sh
#   MY_ENV=nomx resoft
# 
# When not explicitly set, MY_ENV is simply the empty string "".
#
