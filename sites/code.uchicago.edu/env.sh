# 6.3 Building and Installing HPCToolkit
# Q: Do I need to compile HPCToolkit with any special options for MPI
# support?
# A: No, HPCToolkit is designed to work with multiple MPI
# implementations at the same time. That is, you don’t need to provide
# an mpi.h include path, and you don’t need to compile multiple versions
# of HPCToolkit, one for each MPI implementation.  The
# technically-minded reader will note that each MPI implementation uses
# a different value for MPI_COMM_WORLD and may wonder how this is
# possible. hpcrun (actually libmonitor) waits for the application to
# call MPI_Comm_rank() and uses the same communicator value that the
# application uses. This is why we need the application to call
# MPI_Comm_rank() with communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD.

# (The -I is the object directory containing the source files of
# the profiled flash3 binary)
