How to do performance monitoring on the Cray XT3 system using CrayPat

1. module load craypat (default will become 3.1)

2. Build application as usual (make)

3. Instrument application with pat_build
  - pat_build -g [group] -u flash3
  - g group options are mpi, io, heap (can only use one a a time?)
  - default -g group is instrumentation at the function level
  - u option for user functions
  - .o files must be available for pat_build!  

  Examples
	pat_build -g mpi,io,heap -u flash3  (gives mpi,io,heap instrumentation)
	pat_build -u    flash3  (instrument only user functions)

  - Running the pat_build command will create a file called flash3+pat

  

4. Run instrumented code with PBS or yod interactive commands
  
  if you want to collect info on hardware counters at this point
  - set other environmental varialbes like PAT_RT_HWPC 	(1-9)
  - yod -sz 256 flash3+pat
  
  - Code must be run on Lustre!

  - When code is run a file called flash3.out+[PID]em.xf will be created.
  

5. Generate performance file (.ap2) with pat_report
  
  - pat_report -f ap2 [options] <.xf file>
  - the basic options are 
	-o output_file (if I want a different name?)

  - This will generate a file called flash3.ap2?

6. Analyze results with Cray Apprentice2 or pat_report

  6.1> pat_report [options] flash3.ap2 | less

  6.2> for visualization 
  - module load apprentice2/3.1
  - app2 flash.ap2
  - have fun!
